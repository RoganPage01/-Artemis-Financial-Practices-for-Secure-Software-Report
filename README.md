# -Artemis-Financial-Practices-for-Secure-Software-Report
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial, concerned about potential security breaches, sought to fortify their web application's security by implementing encryption and transitioning to HTTPS protocol.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
Implemented asymmetric encryption using SHA-256 for heightened security. Conducted self-signed certificate generation, code refactoring, and secondary testing using dependency check tools to ensure compliance with security enhancements.
 
What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Secure coding is crucial to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and financial loss. It adds value to a company's overall wellbeing by protecting sensitive data and maintaining customer trust.
 
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
The vulnerability assessment process provided a structured approach to identify and address security concerns. It highlighted the importance of regular dependency checks and proactive security measures.
 
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Introduced a secure RestController and SHA-256 hashing algorithm. Recommending bi-monthly dependency checks and plugin updates to maintain security standards.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Conducted functional testing post-refactoring to ensure error-free execution. Used checksum verification and HTTPS testing to confirm secure communication. Leveraged Java Keytool for certificate generation, security libraries for encryption deployment, and dependency check tool for static testing. Followed best practices such as regular dependency checks and plugin updates.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
Examples of successful code refactoring, secure communication implementation, and vulnerability assessments would demonstrate proficiency in secure software development to potential employers.
